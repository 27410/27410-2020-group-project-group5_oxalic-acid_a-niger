# 27410 - Group assignment - Group [Group Number] - [TITLE]

> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the
> requested information below and above ([Group Number] and [TITLE]) and remove this quoted part before submission (everything prepended with a >).
> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.
> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
Oxalic acid has been of industrial importance ever since, traditionally obtained through chemical synthesis. However, the chemical synthesis affords the use of harsh chemicals like sulphuric acid and high temperatures up to 360 Â°C leading to a high energy consumption. Biological production of oxalic acid could provide a sustainable alternative with the possibility of using waste products like cashew apple juice as substrate. However, major drawbacks are low yields and low productivity, mainly due the oxidation of glucose and loss of energy in unfavorable pathways.

As an organic acid, Oxalic acid can be considered as a low value chemical, meaning having an abundant and cheap feedstock as well as great fermentation metrics is key to compete with the existing chemical processes. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, a final product titer of minimum 100 g/L at the end of fermentation is desired, which has already been achieved in Aspergillus niger fermentations by some research groups. However, the productivity has to be increased to at least 5 g/L*h. Productivity has, as presented previously already, been significantly lower than the desired value. Finally, the yield YSP has to be improved closer to the maximum theoretical yield of 4 considering sucrose as substrate. Highest achieved yield compared to the maximum theoretical yield was 64,2 %.

To achieve an economically favourable process, different substrates, gene knockouts, overexpression of genes and regulators should be investigated with an optimized Aspergillus niger iJB1325 model
